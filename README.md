W8 DQ-1
Let's consider a dataset Crop Production & Climate Change from Kaggle.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Research Questions & Hypotheses
Research Question: Which crops ('SUBJECT') have shown the most significant changes in yield over time ('TIME')?
1.	Hypothesis: The yield of certain crops is more variable than others, indicating different levels of resilience or susceptibility to external factors.
Types of Visualizations & Statistical Techniques
•	Time Series Analysis: To investigate how crop yields have changed over time.
•	Box Plots and Violin Plots: To compare the distribution of yields across different crops and locations.
•	Line Plots: To visualize trends in crop yields over time.
•	Bar Graphs: To compare the average yields of different crops or in other locations.

Analytical Approach in Python
1.	Data Preparation: Used pandas for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
2.	Trend Analysis: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create line plots showing trends in crop yields over time.
3.	Comparative Analysis: Use box plots and bar graphs to compare yields across crops and locations.
4.	Statistical Testing: If necessary, we can also perform statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to determine if differences in crop yields are significant.
